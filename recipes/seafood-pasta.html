    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Drain noodles but reserve 1 cup of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, season shrimp and scallops with a pinch of salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shrimp and scallops and cook for about 2 minutes per side (until shrimp is pink and both are opaque), then transfer to a plate. Cover with foil to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 3 tablespoons butter to skillet. Add shallots and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Add wine and bring to a simmer, cooking for a few minutes. Add clams and mussels then cover with a lid and cook for 4-5 minutes, until shells open. Remove mussels and clams to the plate with the other seafood (discard any shells that didn’t open).</li>
        <li>Stir 1 teaspoon cornstarch into the cream. Add cream mixture, bouillon, and ¾ cup of the parmesan to the pan and cook until sauce has slightly thickened. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if needed.</li>
        <li>Add pasta and lemon zest and toss to coat. Add seafood. Garnish with parsley and remaining parmesan. Enjoy.</li>
